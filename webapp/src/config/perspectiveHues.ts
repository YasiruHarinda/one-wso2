/**
 * One identity colour per perspective, for the app launcher.
 *
 * Why colour at all: the launcher is scanned, not read. Six tiles that differ only
 * by glyph and label force you to read each one; a stable hue per perspective makes
 * finding one pre-attentive. Six is also about the ceiling — past eight or ten,
 * hue discrimination collapses and you are back to reading labels.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the launcher alone. The rail already signals "you are here"
 * with selection state, so a hue there would compete with a signal that works;
 * the launcher is the one surface with nothing else doing that job.
 *
 * SIZING, and the constraint that will eventually break this: the registry holds
 * nine perspective hues. Infra is the ninth, kept as its own teal so the launcher
 * tile stays distinct from UMT. Hue discrimination collapses somewhere past that,
 * and each new perspective wants one — at which point the answer is a different
 * encoding (hue per domain family, or back to monochrome), not a longer list.
 * perspectiveHues.test.ts caps the palette at nine so that decision is forced
 * rather than drifted into.
 *
 * TREATMENT: the glyph is the hue's dark shade on a wash of the same hue — not a
 * saturated fill with a white glyph. White-on-hue measures 3.05–3.99:1 across these,
 * which passes WCAG 1.4.11 (3:1 for meaningful icons) with nothing left over
 * for another perspective. The washes below measure 4.53–5.37:1 in light and
 * 3.83–5.01:1 in dark — both comfortably clear of the floor. Those figures are
 * asserted, not annotated: the test recomputes them from these hexes.
 *
 * The dark values are counter-intuitive and worth not "fixing": in dark mode the
 * glyph is the hue *itself*, so a stronger wash moves field and glyph together and
 * closes the gap. Dark therefore uses a weaker wash (12%) than light (14%).
 *
 * Values are precomputed rather than composited at runtime so they can be read,
 * reviewed, and asserted — see perspectiveHues.test.ts, which fails if any pair
 * drops below the 3:1 floor.
 *
 * OPEN: seven of these eight are not brand colours. The WSO2 brand system defines one
 * accent, so a palette this wide needs a brand-owner ruling — the same conversation
 * as the 180x72px logo minimum and the contained-button contrast. Until then this is
 * launcher-local and easy to withdraw.

  // It is NOT the green it was originally given (#678F3D, 89 degrees). Upstream
  // added umt at 85.7 degrees while this was in flight, putting the two 3.6
  // degrees apart: the same green twice, and neither findable by colour. The
  // wheel's two remaining openings were 124 (between umt and finance) and 301
  // (between csm and marketing). 124 is wider — 38 degrees of clearance against
  // 32 — but it is a third green in a palette that already has umt's olive and
  // finance's teal, so the extra degrees buy nothing a user can act on. 301 is
  // 32.6 from csm and 31.4 from marketing, both comfortably past the palette's

  // Saturation and lightness deliberately copy csm's (0.68/0.58): this sits in
