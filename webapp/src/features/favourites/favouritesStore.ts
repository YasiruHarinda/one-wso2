 * Favourite apps, for the launcher.

 * They are different things with different lifetimes:
 *
 *  - A pin is a transient working set of PAGES, capped at eight, surfaced in the
 *    header strip while you are busy with them.
 *  - A favourite is a stable preference about an APP, surfaced in the launcher.
 *
 * Sharing one capped store between the two would mean favouriting a handful of
 * apps quietly eats the budget for pinning the page you are working on. Kept
 * apart, each stays simple. The two do share the identity source
 * (`useAsgardeoSub`), so nothing is duplicated but the storage key.
 *
 * No cap: the ceiling is the number of reachable perspectives, which is small,
 * and favouriting all of them is a coherent thing to want.
